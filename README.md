# Filmete

Filmete is a simple discord bot that uses Watch2Gether API to create a room for a bunch of people in a server to watch videos together.

This is different compared to the normal share screen by Discord in which this bot allows any participant in the room to pause, play, and seek position. This is inclusive of adding videos into the queue.
